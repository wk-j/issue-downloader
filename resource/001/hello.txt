On the CI server, I want to fetch a config file that we maintain on Github so it can be shared between many jobs. I'm trying to get this file via curl, but these approaches both fail (I get a 404):

# As advised by the oAuth docs
curl -H 'Authorization: token the_token' -L -o setup.sh https://raw.github.com/org/repo/file

# The url of the raw file after clicking to view it
curl -L https://raw.github.com/org/repo/file?login=username&token=the_token
